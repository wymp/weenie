Weenie Framework
=================================================================================

The Weenie Framework is a strongly typed dependency injection framework for Typescript.

It was born out of a frustration with giganto-frameworks like Nest and a desire to keep things
small, light and composable, and with a special focus on empowering developers to build with it
whatever and however they wish _without the framework getting in the way._ It is designed to be
highly unopinionated.

To this end, Weenie was built like a cheap fake Christmas tree: It provides a central pole on which
you can hang just about anything. The idea is that each "branch" that you hang on the central pole
changes the definition of the pole for the branch that follows. It thus builds a dependency tree
where later dependencies may depend on earlier dependencies, and all current dependencies are both
known and strictly typed at each step.

What you hang on that dependency tree and what you do with it is entirely up to you. The example
in [`src/example.ts`](src/example.ts) is a decent look at what _I_ usually do with it and how.
That is, it demonstrates the deliberate building of a "resource bag" (a dependency injection
container), which I then use in event handlers and API request handlers to execute my core
logic.

And why go through all the trouble of doing it this way?

Frankly, this makes sense to me, and it makes each individual component much more narrowly scoped
and easier to test. Using this structure, I can mock out the entire tree for my test cases, and
I can easily encapsulate my application logic in functions that themselves have a very narrow set
of dependencies. And that allows me to focus my development and treat every component as it should
be treated - as a small, isolated unit that does one thing well and uses very few other things to
do it.

Here's `src/example.ts`, copied for convenience:

```ts
import {
  // Base framework function
  Weenie,

  // Config stuff (all of these actually come from the `weenie-base` package)
  configFromFiles,
  baseConfigValidator,
  databaseConfigValidator,
  webServiceConfigValidator,
  apiConfigValidator,

  // Functions that hang things on the tree
  logger,
  mysql,
  httpHandler,

  // Extra things for building the special api instantiator
  BaseApiDeps,
  ApiClient,
  ApiConfig,
} from "./";

// Runtypes for creating a final config validator
import * as rt from "runtypes";

// Some simple interfaces, used for creating our api clients (you might normally put these and the
// api client instantiation logic somewhere else, but it's all here to make the example more
// contained)
import {
  SimpleLoggerInterface,
  SimpleHttpClientInterface,
  SimpleSqlDbInterface,
} from "ts-simple-interfaces";

/**
 * Create final config definition
 *
 * Here, we're using the "base" config from weenie-base (which includes things like config for
 * an exponential backoff system, an initialization system, a logger, and environment awareness)
 * and we're adding config for a database, webservice provider, and two arbitrary API clients.
 *
 * This config contains all of the keys necessary to instantiate the rest of our dependencies.
 */
const exampleConfigValidator = rt.Intersect(
  baseConfigValidator,
  rt.Record({
    db: databaseConfigValidator,
    webservice: webServiceConfigValidator,
    firstApi: apiConfigValidator,
    secondApi: apiConfigValidator,
  })
);
declare type ExampleConfig = rt.Static<typeof exampleConfigValidator>;

/**

/**

   * with a specific configuration that is considered the "weenie" way.
   */

   */
  .and(mysql)

  /**
   * Now we'll add our API clients. These we have to make kind of custom because it's impossible
   * to create a general function that provides both correct typing and access to the correct
   * configs without dangerous casting.
   *
   * To make it a little bit cleaner, Weenie provides the `BaseApiDeps` type, which defines an
   * environment-aware config and a logger. Then we just have to add our specific new config keys.
   */
  .and((d: BaseApiDeps & { config: { firstApi: ApiConfig; secondApi: ApiConfig } }) => {
    return {
      firstApi: new ApiClient({ envType: d.config.envType, ...d.config.firstApi }, d.logger),
      secondApi: new ApiClient({ envType: d.config.envType, ...d.config.secondApi }, d.logger),
    };
  })

  /**
   * For our IO abstraction, normally we would build this in a separate file and pull it in as a
   * module, but for this example, we'll just do it ad-hoc.
   *
   * The idea is to encapsulate all of the IO functionality we want to use here behind a defined,
   * declarative interface instead of doing raw queries, which are hard to stub out in testing.
   *

---

This example is pretty trivial. However, it's very functional, and it demonstrates how easy it
would be to modify the framework. Have a standard DBAL that you like? You can just write a
function that hangs it on the tree configured the way you like it, and then for any service that
you create, all you have to do is `.and(myDbal)`. Want a global cache? `.and` it in. Want an
exponential backer-offer? `.and` it in.

One of the interesting parts about this is that you can abstract whole parts of the tree away into
modules that represent your personal "way of doing things." For example, I could take the above and
wrap it into a `MyService` function, pass that to Weenie as a starting point and just start
`.and`ing from there.

Best of all, you can release lightweight functions that configure things in a useful way (logger
and config manager are ones that come mind as areas where people like to do things a variety of
different ways) and other people can incorprate those into _their_ microservices by just `.and`ing
them in.

## Future Development

For now, this framework provides just about all the functionality that I want from it. I don't have
any immediately plans for additional development, although I'm certainly open to adding more and/or
changing things. Feel free to submit an issue for any suggestions.
